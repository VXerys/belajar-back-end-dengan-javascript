## üåü Introduction to Node.js  

Node.js is a revolutionary technology that allows JavaScript to be executed outside the browser. Before Node.js, JavaScript was confined to the front-end, requiring developers to learn additional languages for back-end development. In 2009, Ryan Dahl introduced Node.js, a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, enabling JavaScript to run on servers.  

Today, Node.js powers major applications for companies like Netflix, Uber, PayPal, and eBay. Its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model makes it lightweight and efficient, ideal for building scalable back-end systems.

## üöÄ Running JavaScript with Node.js  

### Node.js REPL  
The Node.js REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is an interactive environment for executing JavaScript code. It reads your input, evaluates it, prints the result, and loops back to wait for the next input. For example:  
```javascript
> console.log('Hello Node.js REPL');  
Hello Node.js REPL  
undefined  
```  
The `undefined` appears because `console.log()` does not return a value.  

### JavaScript Files  
To execute JavaScript code from a file, create a `.js` file and run it using the `node` command:  
```bash
node filename.js  
```  
This method is ideal for larger scripts and applications.

## üåç Node.js Global Objects  

### True Globals  
Node.js introduces several global objects:  
- `global`: The global namespace.  
- `process`: Provides interaction with the current Node.js process.  
- `console`: Handles standard input/output operations.  
- `setTimeout`, `clearTimeout`, `setInterval`, `clearInterval`: Manage timers.  

### Pseudo-Globals  
These are not direct members of the `global` object but are accessible globally:  
- `module`: Used for modularization.  
- `__filename`: Returns the file path of the current module.  
- `__dirname`: Returns the directory path of the current module.  
- `require`: Imports modules.  

---

## üîß The Process Object  

The `process` object provides information about the current Node.js process. Key properties include:  
- `process.env`: Stores environment variables.  
- `process.env.PWD`: Current working directory.  
- `process.env.USER`: Current user.  

You can also set custom environment variables:  
```javascript
process.env.NODE_ENV = 'development';  
```  
This is useful for configuring behavior based on the environment.  

---

## üß© Modularization in Node.js  

Modularization is the practice of splitting code into independent modules, each with a single responsibility. In Node.js, every JavaScript file is a module. Use `module.exports` to export values:  
```javascript
// math.js  
module.exports = { add: (a, b) => a + b };  

// app.js  
const math = require('./math');  
console.log(math.add(2, 3)); // Output: 5  
```

## üì¶ Node Package Manager (NPM)  

NPM is the default package manager for Node.js, used to install and manage third-party modules. Key commands:  
```bash
npm install package-name  
npm uninstall package-name  
```  
Modules can be installed globally or locally. Local installation is recommended to avoid conflicts.  

---

## üéØ Event-Driven Programming in Node.js  

Node.js follows an event-driven architecture, where actions are triggered by events. The `EventEmitter` class from the `events` module is used to handle events:  
```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');  
const emitter = new EventEmitter();  

emitter.on('greet', () => console.log('Hello!'));  
emitter.emit('greet');  
```  

---

## üìÇ Working with the Filesystem  

Node.js provides the `fs` module for interacting with the filesystem. Methods like `fs.readFile` and `fs.writeFile` are available in both synchronous and asynchronous versions:  
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');  
fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {  
  if (err) throw err;  
  console.log(data);  
});  
```  

---

## üåä Readable Streams  

Streams allow processing data in chunks, making them efficient for large files. Use `fs.createReadStream` to create a readable stream:  
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');  
const stream = fs.createReadStream('largefile.txt');  
stream.on('data', (chunk) => console.log(chunk.toString()));  
```  

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Writable Streams  

Writable streams are used to write data incrementally. Use `fs.createWriteStream`:  
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');  
const stream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');  
stream.write('Hello, World!');  
stream.end();  
```
