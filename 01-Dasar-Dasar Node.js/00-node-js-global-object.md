## 🌍 Introduction to Global Objects

JavaScript is a versatile programming language that can run in various environments, such as web browsers and server-side platforms like Node.js. However, JavaScript itself doesn't inherently know where it's being executed. It relies on the environment to provide additional functionalities through **global objects**.

- **In Browsers**: The `window` object is the global object. It provides functionalities like navigating between pages, reloading, closing tabs, and displaying alert dialogs.
  
- **In Node.js**: The `global` object serves a similar purpose. It offers functionalities that are essential for server-side development, such as accessing CPU usage, modularizing JavaScript files, and logging values to the console.

Both `window` and `global` are **Global Objects**, meaning their properties and methods are accessible from anywhere in the code.

## 🖥️ Global Object in Node.js

In Node.js, the `global` object is the top-level object that provides a set of properties and methods essential for the environment. Unlike the `window` object in browsers, `global` is tailored for server-side operations.

### Accessing Global Object Members

You can list all the members of the `global` object using the following code:

```javascript
Object.getOwnPropertyNames(global);
```

When executed in the Node.js REPL, this code will return an array of all the properties and methods available in the `global` object.

### Why Use the Global Object?

The `global` object in Node.js is crucial for:

- **Environment Interaction**: Accessing system resources like CPU and memory.
- **Modularization**: Managing and importing JavaScript modules.
- **Debugging**: Logging information to the console.

## 🎯 True Globals in Node.js

Node.js introduces several **true globals**—objects that are directly part of the `global` object and can be accessed globally. These include:

- **`global`**: The global namespace. Any member within this object is accessible globally.
  
- **`process`**: Provides interaction with the current Node.js process. It allows you to access environment variables, command-line arguments, and more.

- **`console`**: Offers functionalities for standard input/output operations, such as logging messages to the console.

- **`setTimeout`, `clearTimeout`, `setInterval`, `clearInterval`**: Functions for handling asynchronous operations and timers.

These true globals are essential for performing common tasks in Node.js applications.

## 🕵️ Pseudo-Globals in Node.js

In addition to true globals, Node.js also has **pseudo-globals**—objects that are not direct members of the `global` object but are accessible globally due to the modular nature of Node.js.

### Key Pseudo-Globals

- **`module`**: Used for modularizing JavaScript files. It allows you to define and export modules.

- **`__filename`**: A keyword that returns the absolute path of the currently executing JavaScript file. Note that this is not available in the Node.js REPL.

- **`__dirname`**: A keyword that returns the root directory of the currently executing JavaScript file.

- **`require`**: A function used to import JavaScript modules. It is essential for managing dependencies in Node.js applications.

### Why Pseudo-Globals?

Pseudo-globals are not part of the `global` object but are inherited from the module scope. Since every JavaScript file in Node.js is treated as a module, these pseudo-globals are accessible as if they were global.

## 🛠️ Practical Examples

Let's explore some practical examples to understand how to use the `global` object and its members effectively.

### Example 1: Accessing Global Object Members

```javascript
// List all members of the global object
const globalMembers = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(global);
console.log(globalMembers);
```

### Example 2: Using `process` Object

```javascript
// Accessing environment variables
console.log(process.env);

// Getting the current working directory
console.log(process.cwd());
```

### Example 3: Modularizing with `require`

```javascript
// Importing a module
const fs = require('fs');

// Reading a file
fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});
```
